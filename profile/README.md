# Accessible Biomedical AI Research

At the intersection of open science and artificial intelligence (AI), we work to
make biomedical research more accessible and AI methodologies more transparent
and effective.

## Mission statement

Our mission is to advance biomedical science by:

1. Making Science Accessible: *We enhance access to scientific knowledge and
computational tools by developing open-source, user-friendly software for
researchers across disciplines.*

2. Understanding AI in Biomedicine: *We critically examine artificial
intelligence techniques—from basic linear models to advanced deep learning—to
understand their strengths and limitations, guiding their effective application
and improvement.*

By combining these synergistic angles, we aim to empower the research community
with the tools and insights needed to drive impactful discoveries in biomedical
science.

## Projects

### The BioCypher ecosystem

We have created the [BioCypher ecosystem](https://github.com/biocypher) to
facilitate access to all aspects of modern knowledge management in biomedicine.
The ecosystem includes a knowledge graph framework—the eponymous
[BioCypher](https://biocypher.org)—and a framework for leveraging large language
models: [BioChatter](https://biochatter.org). The ecosystem was conceived in
collaboration with the [Saez-Rodriguez group](https://saezlab.org) and a
community of developers and scientists.

### Biases in biomedical machine and deep learning

Science improves one model at a time. As the saying goes, "all models are wrong,
but some are useful." We are interested in the biases of biomedical models,
especially machine learning and deep learning models. We ask what makes a model
useful in the current context of biomedical problems: classifying patients,
predicting the effects of perturbations, or aligning gene expression profiles.
We have a particular interest in
[causality](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44320-024-00041-w).

### Software sustainability - DFG528753569

DFG project 528753569 is a three-year project funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG). The project aims to establish a knowledge graph community in
biomedical science. It was conceived in the context of the modernisation of the
popular prior knowledge resource [OmniPath](https://omnipathdb.org) in the
[Saez-Rodriguez group](https://saezlab.org).

### Modernising automated knowledge management - OTAR3088

The OTAR project 3088 is a three-year project funded by the [Open
Targets](https://opentargets.org) organisation. The project aims to modernise
the knowledge management infrastructure of the popular Open Targets Platform,
from the extraction of information from text, via the representation of
knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs, to the integration of knowledge in
downstream machine learning frameworks, including accessibility-improving Large
Language Models.
