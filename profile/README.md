# 🧬 Accessible Biomedical AI Research

<div align="center">

*At the intersection of open science and artificial intelligence (AI), we work to make biomedical research more accessible and AI methodologies more transparent and effective.*

</div>

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Our mission is to advance biomedical science by:

### 🔓 Making Science Accessible
*We enhance access to scientific knowledge and computational tools by developing open-source, user-friendly software for researchers across disciplines.*

### 🤖 Understanding AI in Biomedicine
*We critically examine artificial intelligence techniques—from basic linear models to advanced deep learning—to understand their strengths and limitations, guiding their effective application and improvement.*

## 🧭 Philosophy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We believe in [slo science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_science) (pun
> intended), where we approach problems with a focus on understanding and
> sustainability. In today's research landscape, this can be counterintuitive;
> however, we believe that the individual's flexibility to explore without
> pressure is what makes science great.

Our core principles:

- 🔄 **Reproducibility**: If it's not reproducible, it's not science
- 🤖 **Embracing AI**: Understanding AI as a powerful tool while remaining critical
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure**: Automating the mundane to focus on innovation
- 📚 **Accessibility**: Making science available to everyone
