# Accessible Biomedical Artifical Intelligence Research

At the intersection of open science and artificial intelligence (AI), we work to
make biomedical research more accessible and AI methodologies more transparent
and effective.

## Mission statement

Our mission is to advance biomedical science through two interconnected efforts:

1. Making Science Accessible: *We enhance access to scientific knowledge and
computational tools by developing open-source, user-friendly software for
researchers across disciplines.*

2. Understanding AI in Biomedicine: *We critically examine artificial
intelligence techniques—from basic linear models to advanced deep learning—to
understand their strengths and limitations, guiding their effective application
and improvement.*

By combining these efforts, we aim to empower the research community with the
tools and insights needed to drive impactful discoveries in biomedical science.
